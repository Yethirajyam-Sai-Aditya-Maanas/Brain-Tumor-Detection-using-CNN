Introduction:-
Brain tumors are abnormal growths that can be benign or malignant. Their diagnosis typically involves MRI, CT scans, and PET scans, which provide detailed information about the tumor’s size, location, and characteristics. However, manual analysis of these images is time-consuming and prone to human error, necessitating the use of deep learning techniques like CNNs.
CNNs can learn complex patterns from large medical image datasets, helping in the accurate identification of tumors. This project focuses on the use of CNNs for brain tumor detection, including network design, training processes, and factors affecting accuracy and generalizability.
Methodology

Types of Brain Tumors:-
Brain tumors can be classified based on their origin, behavior, and aggressiveness:
•	Gliomas Arise from glial cells, including astrocytomas and glioblastomas (GBM), which are highly aggressive.
•	Meningiomas Originate from meninges; mostly benign but can cause pressure-related symptoms.
•	Pituitary Adenomas Develop in the pituitary gland, affecting hormone production.
•	Medulloblastomas Common in children, fast-growing tumors in the cerebellum.
•	Metastatic Brain Tumors Originate in other parts of the body (lungs, colon, breast) and spread to the brain.

CNN Architecture:-
CNNs consist of multiple layers designed to process image data effectively:
•	Convolutional Layers Apply filters to extract important image features.
•	Pooling Layers Reduce spatial dimensions to improve computational efficiency.
•	Fully Connected Layers Combine extracted features for classification.
•	Activation Functions Use ReLU, sigmoid, or softmax to introduce non-linearity and improve learning.
Challenges in CNN-Based Brain Tumor Detection
1.	Interpretability Understanding CNN decisions is challenging, making clinical adoption difficult.
2.	Data Dependence Large, well-labeled datasets are needed for effective training.
3.	Technological Changes Variations in imaging techniques can impact model performance.
4.	Overfitting CNNs can memorize training data instead of learning general patterns.
5.	Computational Costs Training deep CNNs requires high-performance GPUs or TPUs.
